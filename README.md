#TestChooser
A Sublime Text 2 plugin for quickly executing a RSpec & Cucumber commands in [iTerm](http://iterm.sourceforge.net/) or Apple's Terminal. This version allows you to use the rspec rake command as well.

## Description
It first checks the current file to see that it is either a "feature" or "spec" file. If so, it reads the file looking for "it", "describe", "context" or "scenario" keywords that are at the beginning of a line.

It then displays those lines for you to choose from. Once you select an item from the list and click "Run", the test is executed in [iTerm](http://iterm.sourceforge.net/) or Apple's Terminal, whichever you have set in preferences. The default is iTerm.
